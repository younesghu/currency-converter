# Simple Currency Converter
<p>
    Currency Converter developed with Laravel, the purpose of this mini-project is to get better with using APIs. In this case I used a free one that allows me to change my currency from EUR to anything I want basically.
    Anyways, here is a screen of how the interface looks like.
